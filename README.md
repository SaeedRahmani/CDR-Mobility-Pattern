# CDR-Mobility-Pattern
In this project, we aim to extract people's mobility patterns and city-wide spatiotemporal interactions from CDR (call detail record) data. For this purpose, we use one month of CDR data for about 10M people in Tehran, Iran. Due to the fact that the project is still ongoing, I am not allowed to reveal the complete scripts with enough comments, but in case of any question please contact me at saeedrmd@gmail.com. Also for reviewing part of the results, please download and unzip the Visualization.rar file in the directory.
